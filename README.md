# Robomigration

## Migration tool for Roboquest saves from Game Pass to Steam

### Warning

**BACK UP YOUR STEAM SAVE FILES IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THEM**
\
**It WILL delete the save files on Steam**.

### Summary

This simple tool will automate the painful step of moving from Game Pass to Steam, since the save files are renamed in a weird way and need to be renamed, depending of the content.

### What does it do

The tool will simply scan the files content, check for keywords and copy them as renamed accordingly.

### Safety precautions

***For safety reasons, it will also copy the save files on the desktop in a folder named `Roboquest_saves_bkp`***
\
It will also not delete the saves from Game Pass, of course.

## Testing, issues and thanks

I have tested this with a fresh new install without saves with success, feel free to open issues if you have any problem!
