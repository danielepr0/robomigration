_Migration tool for Roboquest saves from Game Pass to Steam_

This simple tool will automate the painful step of moving from Game Pass to Steam, since the save files are renamed in a weird way and need to be renamed, depending of the content.
The tool will simply scan the files content, check for keywords and copy them as renamed accordingly. 

For safety reasons, it will copy them on the desktop in a folder named `Roboquest_saves_bkp` aswell

i have tested this with a fresh new install without saves with success, feel free to open issues if you have any problem!
