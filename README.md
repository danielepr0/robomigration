# Robomigration

## Migration tool for Roboquest saves from Game Pass to Steam

## **BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILES AND YOUR STEAM SAVE FILES IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THEM, It WILL OVERWRITE the save files on Steam**
*I am not responsible for data loss even if SUPER unlikely*

## Prerequisites (same as Sotumney's guide, link at the bottom)
On the Game Pass installation:
- Have played the game at least once
- Changed graphics and control settings at least once
- Either failed or completed at least one run
- Obtained at least one wrench (you can by completing one stage)

## What does it do

This simple tool will automate the painful step of moving from Game Pass to Steam, since the save files are renamed in a weird way and need to be renamed, depending of the content.

It will simply scan the files content, check for keywords and copy them as renamed accordingly.

### Safety precautions

***For safety reasons, it will also copy the save files on the desktop in a folder named `Roboquest_saves_bkp`***
\
It will also not delete the saves from Game Pass, of course.

## Testing and issues

I have tested this with a fresh new install without saves with success, feel free to open issues if you have any problem!

## Thanks

Many thanks to [Sotumney and his Steam Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827009411) who inspired this script!
